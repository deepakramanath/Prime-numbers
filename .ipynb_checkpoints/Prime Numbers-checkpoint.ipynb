Once the Prime list is generated, [Prime factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor) are subsequently evaluated."

If this condition is satisfied, we again iterate up to `n`, where we carry out the trial division and check for the reminders. Any Prime number is a natural number that is divisible by 1 and itself producing no other positive divisors. This would mean that when we divide a number, `n` by a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`, we should obtain only two zeros as reminders, one from  the number `1` and the other from `n`.\n",

For those we have only two zero reminders, we append to the `primeNumbers` list."
